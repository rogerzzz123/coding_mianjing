Offset Ordering
Problem
Suppose we are consuming a list of messages from an ordered stream. Each message is represented by its offset, which denotes its order in the stream.


For example, a 4-message stream may look like:


[offset = 0][offset = 1][offset = 2][offset = 3]
However, while messages may arrive in order, we might not necessarily process them in order.


For example, imagine we are processing messages in a multi-threaded environment, and thus we are at the whim of the scheduler. We may process messages in the order [offset = 3][offset = 0][offset = 1][offset = 2], for instance.


When we're finished with a message (i.e. an offset), we need to tell the stream this, so it knows not to send it again. This is called committing an offset.


To "commit an offset" means that we're done with every message up to that offset. In other words, committing an offset of 2 means "I'm done with messages with offsets 0, 1, and 2". That means we can ONLY commit to 2 if we're ALSO done with 0, 1, and 2.


Problem statement


Given a list of offsets, ordered by when they are processed, return a list of offsets that represent the greediest order of commits. That is, when an offset CAN be committed, we MUST commit it.


We can commit an offset X when EITHER:


X = 0, since it is the first message of the stream
All offsets < X are either ready to be committed or are already committed
If we cannot commit offset X, we represent this as -1.
Example 1:
Input: [2, 0, 1]
Output: [-1, 0, 2]


We iterate through each message from left to right:


1). We try to commit 2, but we CANNOT because all previous offsets (0, 1) have not been committed yet. Thus, we append -1 in our result list, which represents NO commit on this offset.
It might help to visualize this state as something like:


                    (ready to be committed 2)
                     ----------
[offset = 0][offset = 1][offset = 2]
2). We try to commit 0, and we CAN because it's the first message of the stream. We commit the offset 0. Thus, we append 0 to our result list.


(committed 0)
xxxxxxxxxx ----------
[offset = 0][offset = 1][offset = 2]
3). We try to commit 1, and we CAN because all messages up to 1 have been committed. We commit the offset 2. Thus, we append 2 to our result list.


                    (committed 2)    
xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx
[offset = 0][offset = 1][offset = 2]
Thus, we output [-1, 0, 2]. Remember, 1 is NOT in the output because the commit of offset 2 encapsulates it.


Example 2
Input: [0, 1, 2]
Output: [0, 1, 2]


We can commit each message as we iterate because each successive offset is the lowest offset we can possibly commit.


Example 3
Input: [2, 1, 0, 5, 4]
Output: [-1, -1, 2, -1, -1]


We do NOT commit 4 and 5. Had we received 3, we would have committed 4 and 5.


Important things to remember


Assume a clean "state of the world" for every function call, i.e. no offsets have been committed thus far (so we must always start at 0).
Every offset is >= 0.
We never have any duplicate offsets.
